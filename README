YO!

So I am super busy and need some help.

The plan is to make the RADDEST, MOST BADASS EMAIL NEWSLETTER TEMPLATE TO HIT THE INBOX!

The current version has some cross-browser email client issues (mainly with the circle issue number) and is in need of some mobile love.

If you have any ideas (code or design) feel free to FORK your life away and I will pull them in ASAP!

Don't forget to check out the issues if you don't know where to start.

If you have any ideas to make WDW better feel free to ping me an email.

BOOM ROCK ON!!!
