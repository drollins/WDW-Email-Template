YO!

So I am super busy and need some help (goddamn full time work!!).

The plan is to make the RADDEST, MOST BADASS EMAIL NEWSLETTER TEMPLATE TO HIT THE INBOX!

The current version has some cross-browser email client issues and is in need of some mobile love.

If you have any ideas (code or design) feel free to FORK you life away and I will pull them ASAP!

Don't forget to check out the issues if you don't know where to start.

BOOM
